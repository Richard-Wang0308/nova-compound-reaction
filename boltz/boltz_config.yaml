# DataLoader optimization - CRITICAL for performance
# With batch_size=1 (mandatory for structure prediction), we MUST process many molecules in parallel via workers
# This prevents GPU from being idle 99% of the time waiting for DataLoader
# Recommended: 8-12 for RTX 3090 (balance between speed, memory, and CPU usage)
# Each worker handles file I/O, RDKit parsing, tokenization in parallel (CPU-intensive)
# WARNING: Too many workers can cause OOM or CPU overload - reduce if process gets killed or CPU spikes
